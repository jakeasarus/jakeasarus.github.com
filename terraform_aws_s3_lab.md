# Terraform AWS S3 Static Website Lab

Terraform can be a tough tool to learn on your own, even with all of the supporting documentation from Hashicorp. Sometimes people just need to see a tool in action and have visual steps to understand it. That is why I created this, so you can have the chance to follow just a few simple steps to create a Terraform module. 

Before you get started, this does get a little bit advanced, but I think you will be able to reverse engineer the steps taken to understand how everything works after the explainations. If not, you can always checkout [my course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate/?couponCode=6A2C3DC1D7F20A87891E) to get the basics of Terraform down pat. 

## Website Bucket

## Conclusion

By this point you should have successfully created your s3 bucket that has a policy that allows public access to read and the content should be deployed via cloudfront! Feel free to use this code for whatever you wish!
